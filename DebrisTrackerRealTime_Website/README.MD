# Space Debris Visualizer

![Explore the Cosmos]


**Do you ever gaze at the night sky, admiring the cosmic wonders above? Imagine a future where this simple pleasure becomes a rarity. The ever-growing menace of space debris threatens to obscure our view of the stars and jeopardize vital satellites.**

At speeds averaging 16,000 mph, even the tiniest piece of space junk can spell disaster when it collides with an active satellite. Our mission is clear: to confront this escalating problem, raise awareness, and provide a tool for future initiatives.

## What We Offer

Our application presents a stunning, real-time 3D model of Earth, revealing the intricate dance of space debris that envelops our planet. Click on any celestial object to unveil a treasure trove of data, including its apoapsis, periapsis, eccentricity of orbit, name, and NORAD ID.

**Our Technology:** We harnessed the power of JavaScript within the React web framework, alongside remarkable open-source libraries like Satellite.js. For the mesmerizing 3D representation of Earth and its orbiting debris, we turned to CesiumJS and Resium.

## Data at Our Fingertips

We culled invaluable data from [space-track.org](https://www.space-track.org/documentation#/api), employing a Python script to distill the essential fields for our project. The Two-Line Element (TLE) format enabled us to calculate orbits, while we also captured apoapsis, periapsis, and eccentricity data for each celestial path.
