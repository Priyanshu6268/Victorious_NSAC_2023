## Problem Statement

Space debris, including defunct satellites and fragments, poses a substantial risk to space missions, satellites, and the International Space Station. The growing quantity and potential longevity of space debris contribute to environmental concerns and risks to other spacecraft, necessitating innovative solutions and collective action for safe and sustainable space activities.

### Brief Explanation of Problem
Space debris has the potential to remain in orbit for extended periods, posing risks to other spacecraft and the International Space Station. With an increasing number of objects occupying Earth's orbit, the problem demands immediate attention and innovative solutions.

### Why Does the Problem Exist?
Over decades, human space missions have left behind defunct satellites, spent rocket stages, and fragments, which accumulate and increase the risk of collisions, further creating more debris and endangering space activities.

## Analysis

With the rising number of satellites and space ventures, the market for space debris tracking and mitigation is expanding, presenting significant growth opportunities in the sector. Existing products and solutions, such as DebrisShield, OrbitCleaner, LeoSweep Services, and DebrisTracker API, offer various approaches to mitigate the challenges posed by space debris.
