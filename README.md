## Problem Statement

Space debris, including defunct satellites and fragments, poses a substantial risk to space missions, satellites, and the International Space Station. The growing quantity and potential longevity of space debris contribute to environmental concerns and risks to other spacecraft, necessitating innovative solutions and collective action for safe and sustainable space activities.

### Brief Explanation of Problem
Space debris has the potential to remain in orbit for extended periods, posing risks to other spacecraft and the International Space Station. With an increasing number of objects occupying Earth's orbit, the problem demands immediate attention and innovative solutions.

### Why Does the Problem Exist?
Over decades, human space missions have left behind defunct satellites, spent rocket stages, and fragments, which accumulate and increase the risk of collisions, further creating more debris and endangering space activities.

## Analysis

With the rising number of satellites and space ventures, the market for space debris tracking and mitigation is expanding, presenting significant growth opportunities in the sector. Existing products and solutions, such as DebrisShield, OrbitCleaner, LeoSweep Services, and DebrisTracker API, offer various approaches to mitigate the challenges posed by space debris.

### Social Benefits
- **G-20 & Sustainable Development Goals**: Prioritize high-risk orbits, support advanced debris removal technologies, and promote responsible space practices.
- **USP**: Develop a "space salvage yard" to recycle and reuse valuable materials from captured debris, protect spacecraft from collisions, and remove debris from orbits used by active spacecraft.

### Recycle and Reuse
Potential strategies involve utilizing debris for new missions, constructing space habitats, employing 3D printing to create new spacecraft parts, and leveraging debris to generate electricity.

## [Space Debris 3-D Visualization Website](https://frontend-g7wvr7trz-milky-wey.vercel.app/)
This website offers an interactive 3D visualization of space debris and provides educational content and real-time tracking data to enhance public awareness about space debris and its impact on space exploration.

### Methodology for Website

- **Software Development**: Employing JavaScript, React, CesiumJS, and Resium for a user-friendly interface and 3D Earth visualization.
- **Interactivity Implementation**: Enabling user interaction with celestial objects.
- **Testing & Refining**: Ensuring accuracy and reliability of the tool through rigorous testing.

## Challenges
- Constantly moving space debris.
- Small-sized debris.
- Debris located in high orbits.
- The potential danger of space debris to astronauts and spacecraft.

## Proposed Solution - App Description
The app offers comprehensive data on space debris, alternative materials for spacecraft construction, decomposition techniques, risk assessments, and a platform for NASA officials to share data and collaborate on space debris research.

### Methodology for App
- **Data Collection and Processing**: Gathering data on space debris characteristics.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizing models like decision trees or neural networks for real-time classification.
- **Real-Time Classification**: Integrating the trained model for continuous analysis and classification of debris objects.
- **User Interface**: Designing an intuitive interface to display classification results.

## Research Part
### Decomposition of Earth Debris
The research addresses methods for decomposing heavy metals used in spacecraft construction, identifying alternative metals, and exploring solutions for space debris decomposition through methods such as laser ablation, plasma torches, and microwave plasma. Additionally, alternatives for metal in spacecraft construction like aerogels and biodegradable polymers are discussed.
